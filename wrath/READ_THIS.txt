LK when you change the code can you make sure the html also works as well?

updated URLComparison to foreign keys (as ZY suggested)
updated page and weblink to work with the new model
figured out why page was so laggy - the problem was that i was beautifulsouping to get the title every time. managed to fix using the foreign keys. 
cut database size by half, only storing one copy of url1, url2 in which url1.url < url2.url
i broke the compare page :( don't think there's a nice way to fix it

figured out why compare was broken, you changed the URLComparison model to foreign key, and that made my form need an actual URL model to function. fixed it.
tried adding ajax but failed miserably, now website sneakily redirects back to the same page after adding URL.
made everything look nicer. Anything else to add?
reminder to do the stuff needed for submission, aka reflections, presentation...attached project.docx for reference

an overview of time complexities (N is number of webpages)
/wswrath/index: O(N)
/wswrath/pages/...: O(N^2)
/wswrath/pages/.../upvote: O(N^2)
/wswrath/pages/.../downvote: O(N^2)
/wswrath/weblink/...: O(N^2)
everything else: O(1)
